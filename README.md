# Labyrinth of Pushdown

A virtural reality experience which aims to teach finite state machines and pushdown automata in a fun and immersive way. States and transitions are represented by rooms and hallways, and the player is allowed to physically traverse these corridors to get a better idea of how a valid string is generated.

The stack is represented by a series of gemstones on the player's sword, and the transitional rules are represented by a pedestals which only open their corresponding doors when the correct gemstone is at the top of the stack.

Once the player reaches the end, they will have created a string consistent with the language.
